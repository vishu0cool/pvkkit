<p>"Quality Education is Everyone’s Right."</p>

<p>For close to three decades now, Sri Balaji Educational Society has been producing a horde of graduates on a successful and critically admired platform. Many of our students achieved great professional success and academic acclaim throughout the country of India and abroad alike. 
</p><p>What started as a vision of one college by Sri. Dr. Palle Raghunatha Reddy, a scholar, a philanthropist, professor in Chemistry and a stalwart among academicians, with dual Ph.D. degrees, is now an Organization which that runs over 45 independent college bodies with over 18000 students and 2500 + staff.
</p><p>I deem it a great privilege and even a greater responsibility to take on the mantle of the passing generation leadership in guiding this educational society to the next level and leading it to a more successful evolution. 
</p><p>The next five years, the focus will be on academic excellence and producing more employable and intellectually gifted individuals so a better community is built. All students are nurtured with individualized and personalized care at their respective institute and will be provided with an abundance of practical exposure as part of their academic training where we become the launching pad for their career and personal success.
</p><p>You would find a wealth of learning opportunities at all institutions run by the Sri Balaji Educational Society that would serve as an essential stepping stone to a fulfilling life and career.
</p><p>We firmly believe that the face of any country can only be changed by her educated populace. 
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Sri Balaji Educational Society and we continually strive to improve and live up to our students’, parents’ and our stakeholders’ expectations.

  </p><p>  With Best Regards, 
</p>
