 <h1>E-Library</h1>
      <p>At PVKKIT, we firmly believe that knowledge cannot be compartmentalized and contained to the college campus and premises only. Our E-Library is a unique and the most used amenity offered to our students; while over 40,000 volumes of paper-based books, journals, papers, and etc., are available in our central library, our E-Library complements with over 35,000 volumes deployed under E-Platform.
