                        The institute believes that the true potential of students cannot be realized through academics alone. The students are provided with opportunities for exploring and enhancing their talents in extracurricular activities through Literary, Cultural and Sports clubs. This helps to promote self- management skills and core values in the students, all of which cumulatively help to groom the students into integrated personalities.

                        The students are involved in a host of other activities. All major events like youth festivals; technical competitions are actively organized and conducted by the student body. There is student representation on various administrative committees like Hostel Management Committee, Canteen Committee, Discipline Committee, Anti Ragging Committee, etc. All Student committees function under the peripheral supervision of faculty. Students thus get an opportunity to shoulder responsibility and understand the issues better, face relevant challenges and compulsions while devising strategies to reach personal and professional pinnacles.
