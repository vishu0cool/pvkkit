                        <h1>CIVIL Engineering</h1>
                         <h2>About Department</h2>
                        <p >The Department Of Civil Engineering is one of the core branches of engineering and provides theoretical & practical knowledge to the students. Construction and its applications also play a vital role in improving the living conditions of the people and maintaining the quality of construction in many different industries.</p>
                        <p >The Civil Department has started a Diploma Course in Civil Engineering in the academic year of 2013 with an intake of 60 students and the department received   ISO: 9001:2008 certification.</p>
                        <p >The department has grown to a level in terms of infrastructural and academic standards on par with other premier institutions in Andhra Pradesh. The Department has excellent lab facilities with state of art equipment. The Department has well-experienced faculty and maintains a faculty-student ratio of 1:15 as per AICTE norms.  All the laboratories namely like Surveying Practice and Plotting, Material Testing Laboratory, Hydraulics Laboratory, CAD Practice, Building Construction Practices and Civil Engineering Work Shop are fully equipped to carry out the experiments as per SBTET Board Syllabus and also beyond curriculum for Diploma Program to impart practical knowledge to students who can take up any assignment after their Diploma Course.</p>
                        <p >Department gives equal importance to promote ethical values as well as personality development. A well-furnished department library with various textbooks, question papers, and material required for students to refer and also made those available in the department library too.</p>

Faculty members are actively involved in research and academic developmental activities and attend seminars/workshops/conferences to acquire technical knowledge about the latest technical developments in the field of Civil Engineering. The Management has a keen interest to promote quality education and provide financial assistance to faculty members for attending seminars/workshops etc. Every year; the Department conducts industrial tours and visits to various industries and Various Irrigation Dams for students as part of their curriculum.</p>
                        <p >The Department encourages staff members to pursue M.Tech & P.hd programmes to improve their qualifications. Department believes in constant development by taking feedback from Students, Parents, Professional bodies, Employers and Alumni for further improvements in the departments.</p>
                        <h2>VISION:</h2>
                        <p >Objective of the Civil Engineering Department is to equip students with skills in the field of Civil Engineering that is concerned with high technical competencies and promote high-end research to meet the current and future challenges in Civil Engineering.</p>
					    <h2>MISSION:</h2>
                        <p >We at PVKK College of Engineering offers intensive knowledge about the Civil Engineering and train the students about various fields such as Irrigation Engineering, Surveying, Steel Structures, Reinforced Concrete Structures, Hydraulics, Engineering Mechanics, Strength of Materials, and gives industrial exposure through modern technology.</p>
                        <h2>VALUES:</h2>
                        <p >The pursuit of excellence.</p>

                        <p >Enrichment by diversity and Service to humanity.</p>
                        <h2>WHY CIVIL..?</h2>
                        <p >Civil engineers are becoming more and more important with time. Now, they are also responsible for looking after the fire control systems and installing quick fire exit points in the buildings they design. This will help in minimizing the loss of life during fire accidents. Civil engineering is one of the oldest of the engineering professions. Ancient feats such as the building of the Egyptian pyramids and Roman road systems are based on civil engineering principles. Another very important aspect of civil engineering is environmental engineering. In this case, the civil engineers are concerned with applications of various methods to purify the contaminated air, water, and soil. The polluted system should be cleaned, the waste extracted and the purified constituent must be sent back to the natural system.</p>
                        <p >Civil engineers are also responsible for building good quality transportation systems like highways, airports, rail lines, seaports, etc. A civil engineer is concerned with determining the right design for these structures and looking after the construction process so that the longevity of these structures is guaranteed after completion. These structures should also be satisfactory for the public in terms of comfort.</p>
