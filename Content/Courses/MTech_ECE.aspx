                        <h1>Electronics And Communication Engineering</h1>
                        <p >Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the best courses in engineering. It is a core subject in which we get enormous job opportunities in either hardware or software field. It covers a wide range of applications which make our life easier and enjoyable such as Television, Radio, computers, telecommunication, etc. They help us to see, hear and communicate over vast distances and do things faster. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and Marconi developed the radio in the 19th century, no one would dream that these two distinct technologies together would create another wonderful product that is Cell Phone (smartphones) which is now part of everybody’s life. So, it is best to choose ECE as your stream at B.Tech in order to have a bright future both with respect to Job and with respect to Masters.</p>
